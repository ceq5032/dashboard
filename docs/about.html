                <div class="about">
                    <p> Our prototype website was developed as part of a discovery flow project in
                        collaboration with a local insurance company. The aim was to learn and apply
                        service design principles through the following stages: Initiation,
                        Research, Ideation, and Prototyping. The final output was a customizable
                        insurance dashboard prototype. </p>
                    <h3> Initiation </h3>
                    <p> Our team CCTJ consisted of four members. Chelsea Quijas, Caleb King, Tyler
                        Dollard, and Jermain Shields. We created a hypothesis based on our project
                        needs. Identified the key audience for the dashboard and defined a vision
                        for the dashboard.</p>
                    <h3> Research </h3>
                    <p>We analyzed publicly available information on insurance dashboards and
                        general dashboard designs. We also conducted interviews with fellow students
                        to understand their experiences with insurance dashboards and identify what
                        information they would find most useful to display. </p>
                    <h3> Ideation </h3>
                    <p> Based on the research findings, we brainstormed and created ideas for the
                        dashboard design. We begin to visualize how the interface could look and
                        function.</p>
                    <h3> Prototyping </h3>
                    <p> Our goal was to create a highly customizable dashboard giving users a sense
                        of ownership. We wanted to include features with customizable colors, button
                        sizes, and information displayed. Enhanced security options to allow users
                        control over their data. Our design was initially sketched on paper and then
                        developed using HTML, CSS, and Java.</p>
